480 Blue SMD LEDs  
60 latched shift registers (continuous daisy-chain)  
1 mbed LPC1768 (Previously 3 Bareduinos and 1 Arduino: https://github.com/YangR13/vol_display)  
Homemade graphite-silver slipring (6 connection points, 5 used)  
1 Brushless ESC (Hobbywing 6A)  
1 3-pin hard drive motor  
15 long coffee stirrers as a substrate for the LEDs and shift registers  
Various cannibalized hard drive parts for a base  
Threaded rod + washers for axis and spacing.  
Photodiode + LED  
A lot of 30-gauge magnet wire  
Lots and lots of hot glue, solder, and superglue.  

Display Dimensions: 15 vertical layers, with 16 LED radius. Currently set at 120 radial divisions (3 degree separation)
